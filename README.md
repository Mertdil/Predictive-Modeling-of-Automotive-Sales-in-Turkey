# Predictive-Modeling-of-Automotive-Sales-in-Turkey
A Data Science Approach with Exploratory Data Analysis, Preprocessing, Model Development, and Deployment using Docker and Flask

### Aim
The project aims to perform multiple linear regression to predict the number of automotive sales in Turkey, including data preprocessing, regression model creation, evaluating model performance, deploying the model as a service, and analyzing the results. The discussion will include an analysis of the success rate of the model, possible errors or improvement suggestions, and a practical application of deploying the model using Docker and Flask and testing it using Postman.

#### Data Exploration and Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values in the dataset and presenting general information about the dataset.

#### Data Analysis:
Analyzing variables, creating a correlation matrix, and building a regression model.
Evaluating the performance of the model and analyzing prediction results.

#### Deploying the Model:
Explaining how the model is deployed as a service using Docker and Flask, and testing it using Postman.


#### Results and Discussion:
Analyzing the success rate of the created model and discussing what the results mean.
Possible errors and improvement suggestions.

#### Resources:
Data sources and literature used.
Libraries and frameworks used include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Flask, and Docker.
